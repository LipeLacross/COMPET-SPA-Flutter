# **GeoMap** - Payment for Environmental Services System

**GeoMap** is a system developed with Flutter, designed to manage beneficiaries, reports, geographical location, and integrations with external services, including Firebase and REST APIs. It offers an intuitive interface to visualize, edit, and register information about environmental areas and beneficiaries' activities, with a focus on features like geolocation, push notifications, and offline storage.

## üî® **Project Features**

* **User Authentication**: Implementation of login, registration, password recovery, and authentication with Firebase.
* **Beneficiary Management**: Viewing, editing, and registering beneficiaries, with detailed information such as personal data and geospatial location.
* **Reports**: Creation, editing, and synchronization of reports with data on environmental areas, vegetation types, and other resources.
* **Location and Geolocation**: Obtaining the user‚Äôs location and manipulating EXIF data from photos, with GPS coordinates support.
* **Push Notifications**: Sending push notifications to users using Firebase Messaging.
* **Local Storage**: Support for offline data storage, using `SharedPreferences` with automatic synchronization when the network is available.
* **Dashboard**: A control panel with interactive graphs and maps that display information about beneficiaries and their activities.
* **Interactive Maps**: Displaying beneficiaries on the map with geospatial data, using `flutter_map` to create dynamic and interactive maps.

## **Features**

### **Beneficiary Management**

The app allows the user to view, add, and edit information about beneficiaries, including personal data and geospatial area. These details can be saved locally or sent to a server.

### **Activity Reports**

The reporting feature enables the user to record activities, such as creating and sending reports about covered areas, vegetation types, natural and human resources, and more.

### **Interactive Maps**

The app uses the `flutter_map` library to display interactive maps. Beneficiary points are shown on the map with markers. By clicking on a marker, the user can view more details about the beneficiary.

### **Push Notifications**

Firebase is used to send notifications to users. Notifications can be scheduled to alert users about new activities or reports, such as syncing offline data.

## **Internationalization**

The project uses `easy_localization` to support multiple languages. Currently, the app is configured to support Portuguese, but new languages can be easily added by creating translation files in `assets/translations/`.

## **Deploy**

### For iOS

1. Open the project in Xcode (`ios/Runner.xcworkspace`).
2. Connect your device or use the simulator.
3. Select **Product > Archive** to create a distribution file.
4. Upload to the App Store.

### For Android
